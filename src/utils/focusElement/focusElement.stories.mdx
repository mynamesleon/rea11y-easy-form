# `focusElement()`

Utility function to focus (via the native `focus` method)
an HTMLElement that does not already have focus.

If the element is not natively focusable/tabbable (determined by the `'tabbable'` library),
then a `tabindex` of `'-1'` will be set on it so that it can receive focus.

The provided argument can be an HTMLElement,
or a React Ref (or at least, an object with a `.current` property).

## Usage

```js
import { focusElement } from 'rea11y-easy-form';

const element = document.querySelector('.element');
const options = { preventScroll: true };
focusElement(element, options);
```
