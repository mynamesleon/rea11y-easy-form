# `useFieldArray()` hook

Functionally this `useFieldArray()` hook is almost identical to the `useFieldArray`
hook available from `react-final-form-arrays`, but with a few advantages/differences:

1. This hook passes all provided field config options along to `useField`
   (e.g. you can use a `beforeSubmit` function if you want to, which you can't do with the hook
   from `react-final-form-arrays` currently)
2. The internals of this hook are memoised
3. This hook returns both a `fields` and `input` property
   (which both reference the same object internally)

## Usage

```jsx
import { useFieldArray } from 'rea11y-easy-form';

const YourComponent = () => {
  const { input, meta } = useFieldArray('field-name', config);
  // your component code here
};
```
