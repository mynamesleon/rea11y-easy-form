# `useAnnounce()` hook

The `useAnnounce()` hook is intended for components that
need to make custom screen-reader announcements after specific interactions.
E.g. a button click that moves an element to another position in the DOM.

The hook also optionally takes a string to be used for the `aria-live`
attribute on the result, which defaults to `'assertive'`.

It returns an `announce()` function that takes a `ReactNode` (element, string, etc.),
and an `announcer` element to be rendered.

## Usage

```jsx
import { useAnnounce } from 'rea11y-easy-form';

const YourComponent = () => {
  const { announcer, announce } = useAnnounce();
  return (
    <div>
      {announcer}
      <button type="button" onClick={() => announce('You did a thing')}>
        Do a thing
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
