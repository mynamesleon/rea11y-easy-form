# `useMutatedFormState()`

The `useMutatedFormState()` hook is a wrapper around
`react-final-form`'s own `useFormState()` hook.
Much like our `useMutatedField()` hook, this one attempts to normalise
some of the `FormState` for asynchronous validation cases.

## The problem this hook attempts to solve

When using asynchronous validation in your form,
either at the `<Field>` or `<Form>` level, the normal
`react-final-form` `useFormState()` resets a lot of its state.
In particular, if asynchronous validation is ongoing, you'll find that the
`error`, `errors`, `valid`, and `invalid` properties all get reset.

If you want to use any of those properties for something like a validation summary,
having those properties reset in this way could be jarring.
E.g. you have a validation summary visible, then some asynchronous validation is triggered
which resets the errors in `FormState` causing the validation summary messaging to disappear,
then the validation finishes and the summary is rendered again.

## How it works

The hook uses React refs to keep track of previous states for certain `FormState` properties,
and mutates the result as needed based on the `validating` state.

**Please note**: you (unsurprisingly) need to subscribe to the `error` and/or `errors`
properties on the `FormState` for this hook to have any meaningful effect.
Or, just like with the normal `useFormState()` hook,
if you don't provide a `subscription` object,
then all of the `FormState` will be subscribed to.

## Usage

```js
import { useMutatedFormState } from 'rea11y-easy-form';

const YourComponent = () => {
  const { errors } = useMutatedFormState({ subscription: { errors: true } });
  // your component code here
};
```
