# `smoothlyScrollIntoView()`

Smoothly (if supported) scroll an element (that is not already in the viewport) into view (using native methods).

This will also vertically scroll the window so that the element is at the top or bottom of the window, based on its original position relative to the viewport.
If the element is too large to fit in the viewport, it will scroll to the top of that element.

## Usage

```js
import { smoothlyScrollIntoView } from 'rea11y-easy-form';

const element = document.querySelector('.element');
smoothlyScrollIntoView(element);
```
