# `useMutatedField()`

The `useMutatedField()` hook is a wrapper around `react-final-form`'s own `useField()` hook,
that attempts to normalise some of the `FieldState` (returned in the `meta` object)
for asynchronous validation cases.

## The problem this hook attempts to solve

When using field-level asynchronous validation, the normal
`react-final-form` `<Field>`/`useField()` resets a lot of its state.

For example, if an `error` already exists on the `FieldState`, and new validation is triggered,
that `error` is cleared (set to `undefined`) while the field is `validating`,
which can be quite visually jarring.

This applies to the `valid` and `invalid` `FieldState` properties as well.

Further to that, if asynchronous validation is repeatedly triggered on a field,
the `validating` state gets reset to `false` when the first
asynchronous function completes, even if others are still ongoing.
This means that you cannot even reliably display a loading indicator
based on the `validating` property.

## How it works

The hook uses React refs to keep track of previous states for certain `FieldState` properties,
and mutates the `meta` object as needed based on the `validating` state.

Because the `validating` property on the `FieldState` is not completely reliable,
the hook also subscribes to the `validating` state of the `FormState`.
This means that, if a field also triggers validation for another field,
then the first field's mutated `validating` state will remain `true`
until the other field finishes validating as well.

**Please note**: you (unsurprisingly) need to subscribe to the `error` and `validating`
properties on the `FieldState` for this hook to have any meaningful effect.

## Usage

```js
import { useMutatedField } from 'rea11y-easy-form';

const YourComponent = () => {
  const { input, meta } = useMutatedField('field-name', config);
  // your component code here
};
```
