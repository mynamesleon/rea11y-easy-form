# Roadmap

## For 1.0

### Core component exports

- `EasyForm` ✓
- `EasyField` ✓

### Form field components

- `Input` ✓
- `Textarea` ✓
- `Checkbox` ✓
- `CheckboxList` ✓
- `ColorInput` ✓
- `Radio` ✓
- `RadioList` ✓
- `Select` ✓
- `Switch` ✓
- `SwitchList` ✓
- `AutoComplete` ✓ (supports multi-select)

### Util components (used by form components, and exported)

- `Fieldset` ✓ (also a container)
- `ErrorMessage` ✓
- `Label` ✓
- `Notice` ✓ (looks like an alert, but not a `role='alert'` element by default)
- `Skeleton` ✓ (for loading states)
- `ValidationSummary` ✓
- `VisuallyHidden` ✓

### Container/unique components

- `AsHtml` ✓
- `Disclosure` ✓
- `Fieldset` ✓ (also a util)
- `FieldRepeater` ✓ (unit tests and thorough manual testing ongoing)
- `FieldConditional` ✓

### Utility/Form functionality hooks

- `useAnnounce` ✓ (for easy screen-reader announcements)
- `useFieldValue` ✓ (for easy form field value fetching)
- `useCheckFieldValue` ✓ (for confirming a field (or fields) has the desired value(s))
- `useMutatedField` ✓ (for correcting common field issues)

### Built-in validation functions

Only the most basic built-in rules to be included. We do not want to bloat the package.

- `isAlpha` ✓
- `isAlphaNumeric` ✓
- `isDate` ✓
- `isEmail` ✓
- `isEmpty` ✓ (reversed for `required` rule)
- `isHexColor` ✓
- `isInteger` ✓
- `isLowerCase` ✓
- `isNumber` ✓
- `isUpperCase` ✓
- `isUrl` ✓

### Miscellaneous / Chore

- Wide-spread CSS variables for easier theming? (not strictly necessary)
- Proper Generics handling for components that take an `as` prop

## Beyond 1.0 ideas

### Form field components

- `StarRating` (how granular? E.g. can it display 3.5 out of 5, but only allow selecting full values?)
- `RichTextEditor` (do we want this as part of the core code? Will be big!)
- `Datepicker` (do we want this? Can use native, and custom can be added)
- `Timepicker` (do we want this? Can use native, and custom can be added)
- `Telephone` (do we want this? Is complex. Can use native, and custom can be added)
