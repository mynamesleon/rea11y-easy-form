The `<EasyField>` component is intended to make field, label, and validation handling
as easy as possible.

## Basic usage

At its core, the `<EasyField>` is an extension to the `react-final-form` `<Field>`,
which means it takes takes all of the same base props, plus a few more.

It sets some opinionated defaults for various `<Field>` props
for the sake of performance and consistency.
It also takes `label` and `description` props,
and has a number of built-in validation rules that can be made use of,
while still allowing for custom validation as well.

<Controls />

### Accessibility

Best of all, the `<EasyField>` component will also handle
the label-description-field relationships for you,
including all of the the needed ARIA attributes. For example:

1. The rendered field is provided with a generated unique `id`,
   which will match the generated `<label>`'s `for` attribute.
2. If a `description` is provided, then the element this is rendered in
   will also have a generated unique `id`, and the rendered field
   will receive an `aria-describedby` prop linking to it. This will respect any
   existing `aria-describedby` prop as well, and will even update for rendered error messages.
3. If you set the `required` prop
   (or a `required` rule in the `validation` object prop)
   then the rendered field will receive an `aria-required` attribute automatically.
4. If the field is in an error state,
   then an `aria-invalid` attribute will be provided as well.

Feel free to inspect the rendered HTML in the examples to see this in action.

### Ordinary `<Form>` usage

The `<EasyField>` can be used used within the `<EasyForm>` component -
such as in the example above - but can also be used directly within
`react-final-form`'s normal `<Form>` component. E.g.

<Canvas of={OrdinaryFormExample} />

## Advanced Usage

### Overrides to default `<Field>` behaviour

As mentioned above, `<EasyField>` sets some opinionated defaults,
particularly for the `subscription`, `validateFields`, and `parse` props.

#### Subscription

By default `react-final-form`'s `<Field>` subscribes to all of the `FieldState`.
But in 99% of cases, that's overkill, and causes a lot of unnecessary re-renders.
Instead, by default, `<EasyField>` will subscribe only to the parts of `FieldState`
that it needs to (though you can override this of course).

`<EasyField>` also doesn't pass any of the underlying `FieldState`'s `meta` object
to the rendered Field. But you can override that with the `meta` boolean prop.

So let's set up some examples, and use the `meta` prop
to show which parts of the `FieldState` are exposed.

<Canvas of={SubscriptionsExample} />

#### `validateFields`

This is a simpler one. By default, `react-final-form`'s `<Field>` triggers validation
on all fields within the form whenever **any** field value changes.
Once again, in 99% of cases, that's overkill and causes a lot of unnecessary re-renders.

Instead, by default, when an `<EasyField>` value changes,
only that field is validated - not every field.
You can return this to the default `react-final-form` `<Field>` behaviour
by explicitly setting the `validateFields` prop to `undefined`.
More on that in a bit.

#### `parse`

Another simple one. By default, `react-final-form` `<Field>`s
convert empty strings to `undefined`. Instead, `<EasyField>` sets the `parse` prop
to an identity function (`(v) => v`), retaining empty string values.

You can override this by setting your own `parse` function, and, just as with the
`subscription` and `validateFields` props, you can reset this to the original
`react-final-form` `<Field>` behaviour by explicitly setting it to `undefined`.

### Validation

You can use the normal `validate` function prop
as you would with `react-final-form`'s `<Field>` component,
as well as a small number of built-in validation rules via the `validation` object prop,
namely:

- alpha
- alphanumeric
- date
- email
- empty
- hexcolor
- integer
- lowercase
- number
- uppercase
- url
- required

These can be set to a string (for the validation message),
boolean `true` (in which case, the key will be used as the validation message),
or you can set a custom function. When used in an `<EasyForm>`,
you can also define additional global rules or override existing ones
(see the EasyForm story for more detail on that).

You can also set the `required` prop directly on the `<EasyForm>` for simplicity.

Additionally, when using asynchronous validation, the normal `react-final-form` `<Field>`
resets the `error` `FieldState`. This can cause quick flashes
where an error message renders, then disappears while the field is validating, then renders again.
As this is visually jarring, the `<EasyField>` retains any existing error `FieldState`
while the field is validating using our `useMutatedField()` hook.

You can also specify which bits of `FieldState` should be used to determine
if the error should render using the `errorLogic` object prop.
This accepts a `FieldSubscription`-like object, and is set to `{ touched: true }` by default.
`<EasyField>` will automatically take this into account and subscribe to those parts
of the `FieldState` (if they haven't been specified already).
You can also specify that part of the `FieldState` should be `false`
and the `<EasyField>` will check that too.

So let's set up some examples to show all this:

<Canvas of={ValidationExample} />

Please note, all validation functions other than the `required` rule will only run
if the field value is **not** `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string.
This logic is intentional so that custom validation rules do not need to check
for the existence of a current value before doing their checks.
