Built on top of `react-final-form`, the `<EasyForm>` component aims to make setting up
forms in React as easy as possible. It includes simple and extensible handling
of common form aspects, such as defining shared validation rules, generating a validation summary
after submit attempts, global `disabled` handling throughout the form, etc.

The fundamental feature of the `<EasyForm>` however is its `structure` prop -
an array of objects that can be used to generate the entire form.
This is particularly useful for any applications that include form building
and store/return that structural data from API endpoints.

## Basic usage

The `<EasyForm>` takes the same base props as `react-final-form`'s `<Form>`,
plus some additional props mainly for global/default field behaviour,
and configuring the validation summary.

So let's set up a quick login form example,
using built-in validation rules (`required`, and `email`),
with default validation summary behaviour
(which will render after a submission attempt fails).

<Primary />

<Controls />

As with `react-final-form`'s normal `<Form>`, you can also use
`children`, `render`, or `component` props to render your content.
You can even combine those with the `structure` prop.
**Please note** however, that the content rendered based
on the `structure` prop will always render first. E.g.

<Canvas of={LoginFormWithStructureAndChildren} />

### `header` and `footer`

You can optionally provide `header` and/or `footer` props to be rendered as part of the form.
These can be a simple string (or any other `ReactNode`), or you can pass a function
which will receive all of the normal `FormRenderProps` (minus the `handleSubmit` prop)
and should return a `ReactNode`.

**Please note**, when passing a function, the props it receives are dependent on the
`subscription` prop (just as with a normal `react-final-form` `<Form>`).

The `footer` is expected to be used for rendering your own submit/reset buttons as needed.
A default submit button is rendered if a `footer` prop does not exist (and as long as
`submitText` and `onSubmit` props exist), but if a `footer` is provided,
you will need to handle this yourself.

<Canvas of={LoginFormWithHeaderAndFooter} />

### Understanding `structure`

Thankfully the `structure` prop is fairly simple. Each object in the array
is expected to have a `type`. This `type` is then checked against the default (and supplied)
`containers` and `components` to determine what component should render.

When rendering a component for a form field, every other property on the object
gets passed to the `<EasyField>` to be handled from there.
So core functional properties on the object such as `label`, `description`,
`validation`, and `validate` are handled by `<EasyField>` for all of its accessibility benefits.

That also means that you can define things like the field `subscription` and `errorLogic`
within the form `structure` too, as well as being able to define global defaults
on the `<EasyForm>`. A quick example might help:

<Canvas of={LoginFormWithUniqueFieldSetup} />

## Advanced usage

### Using your own components with `structure`

As mentioned in the [understanding structure](#understanding-structure) section,
the objects in the `structure` array are expected to have a `type` that matches up
to one of the available components internally.
You can also define your own components for a specific `type`,
override any of the default `type`s, or define a `component`, `render`, or `children`
property on the object in your `structure` array.

Having multiple ways to do this makes it sound complex,
so let's see this in action to show how easy it is!

This will be our custom component.

```jsx
const customComponent = ({ meta, ...props }) => (
  <div className="custom-component">
    <Input {...props} type="text" />
    <p>{JSON.stringify({ ...props, meta })}</p>
  </div>
);
```

We're printing out all the props so that it's clear what's passed to it by the
`<EasyField>` that's used internally. The `<EasyField>` will handle a selection of
core properties (`label`, `validation`, etc.) and will then pass the `aria-` attributes,
`value`, etc. on to our custom component.

We can then use our custom component by defining it in the `components` object prop
(where the keys in the object determine the `type` to be used within the `structure` array),
or by using it directly in the objects in the `structure` array.
You can see the various ways this can be done in the code for this example -
and we're throw in a `type` that doesn't match a component too, to show how that's handled:

<Canvas of={FormWithCustomComponent} />

You can safely use lazy components as well.
Because all of the properties get passed to the `<EasyField>` first, which then renders
your custom component, the field will be registered by the form straight away
(including its validation rules).

### Defining default field behaviour

The `<EasyForm>` can take `defaultFieldValidationFunctions`,
`defaultFieldErrorLogic`, and `defaultFieldConfig` props to define behaviour for every field.
These can then be overridden by the props for each field as needed.

This will work for fields defined within the `structure` prop, as well as any other usage of
`<EasyField>`, as long as its within the `<EasyForm>`. For example:

<Canvas of={LoginFormWithUniqueFormAndFieldSetup} />

### Validation

Form level validation is done in exactly the same way as the `react-final-form`
`<Form>` component - via the `validate` function prop. That will be passed directly to
the `<Form>` used internally. So that is exactly as you would expect.

You can also specify `defaultFieldValidationFunctions` on the `<EasyForm>` component though.
This is an object of validation functions that can be used by each field
in its `validation` object, simply by using the same key.
You can find further details about all of the included defaults on the
[`<EasyField>` documentation page](?path=/docs/easyfield--docs#validation).

### Validation summary

The validation summary is another fundamental built-in feature of the `<EasyForm>` component.
It will render after a submission has failed, and its content
can be controlled via the `validationSummary` prop.

#### `validationSummary` prop

There are some short-hand values you can use (more on that in a moment),
but in its most expanded form, the `validationSummary` prop's value matches this type:

```ts
type EasyFormValidationSummaryInfo = {
  position?: 'afterbegin' | 'afterend' | 'beforebegin' | 'beforeend';
  content?: 'errors' | 'labels';
  mode?: 'dynamic' | 'static' | 'none';
  renderLogic?: FormSubscription;
  header?: ReactNode;
  footer?: ReactNode;
  render?: ((ref: ForwardedRef<HTMLElement>) => ReactNode) | null;
};
```

So let's explain these one at a time:

1. **`position`**: when setting this, think of 'begin' as the `header` prop,
   and 'end' as the `footer` prop. How the positioning works is intuitive from there.
   The default is `'afterbegin'`.
2. **`content`**:
   1. When set to `'errors'` (the default), the `errors` and `submitErrors`
      from the `FormState` will be listed in the validation summary.
   2. When set to `'labels'`, the `label` prop/property
      from each field with an `error` or `submitError` will be used instead.
3. **`mode`**:
   1. If this is set to `'dynamic'` (the default), then the validation summary
      will update its content as the `FormState` does. So if the `FormState`'s `errors`
      and/or `submitErrors` change, then the validation summary's content will update too
      (this scenario uses a `<FormSpy>` internally so that there is no need to subscribe
      to the `errors` or `submitErrors` on the `<EasyForm>` itself).
   2. If the `mode` is set to `'static'`, then a snapshot of the `errors`
      and `submitErrors` is taken whenever a submit fails, and that snapshot is used instead.
      So the validation summary's content will quite literally remain static
      and will not update until another form submission is attempted.
   3. You can also set the `mode` to `'none'` to disable the validation summary.
4. **`renderLogic`**: this is a `react-final-form` `FormSubscription`-like object
   which works in exactly the same way as the `errorLogic` prop for the `<EasyField>`.
   It defaults to only rendering the validation summary when `submitFailed` is `true`,
   but you can even check for parts of the `FormState` being `false`.
5. **`header`**: this is content to be rendered within the validation summary container,
   _before_ the errors/labels list.
6. **`footer`**: this is content to be rendered within the validation summary container,
   _after_ the errors/labels list.
7. **`render`**: if a `render` function is provided, then the expectation is
   that you will handle all of the content yourself, including the container component,
   and having to use a `<FormSpy>` or `useFormState()` to get the error data.
   So, in this scenario, the only other properties from this list that have any effect
   are the `position` string and `renderLogic` object; all others will be ignored.

The default validation summary logic (which you can see in all of the examples so far)
equates to setting the `validationSummary` prop to:

```ts
{
  renderLogic: { submitFailed: true },
  position: 'afterbegin',
  content: 'errors',
  mode: 'dynamic',
}
```

After all that, it's time for an example!

Here we're setting the `validationSummary` to have a `header`,
with a `position` of `'beforeend'`, `content` set to `'labels'`,
and the `mode` set to `'static'`:

<Canvas of={LoginFormWithStaticLabelsValidationSummary} />

#### Shorthand `validationSummary` prop values

1. Leaving the prop `undefined`, setting it to boolean `true`,
   or setting it to the string `'dynamic'`,
   are all shorthand alternatives for the default object.
2. Setting the prop to the string `'static'` uses the default object,
   but with the `mode` set to `'static'`
3. Setting `validationSummary` to a boolean `false` or the string `'none'`
   will disable the validation summary

#### Validation summary `submitError`

The `<EasyForm>` validation summary considers the `submitError` to take priority
over all other errors. This means that, if a `submitError` exists in the `FormState`,
and your `renderLogic` conditions are met, then that error will be dislayed in the
validation summary area on its own (without rendering the `header` or `footer`).

To coincide with this, if the `<EasyForm>` `onSubmit` function throws an error,
then this will be caught internally and used for the `submitError`. E.g.

<Canvas of={LoginFormWithSubmitError} />

#### Validation summary accessibility

After a submission attempt fails, it's important that users are properly notified
of errors in the form. This is why the validation summary is enabled by default,
and defaults to rendering when the `FormState` `submitFailed` property is `true`.

But the appearance of the element alone isn't enough, as screen-reader users
may not be notified of it.

So, the `<EasyForm>` will automatically attempt to move focus and scroll the page
to the validation summary element after a submission attempt has failed.
And, when the `mode` is set to `'static'`, or when the `submitError` is displayed,
the summary will also have `role='alert'` set on it. **Please note**, the `role` attribute
is set automatically only in those cases, because if `role='alert'` was set on the
`'dynamic'` validation summary, then the the assertive
screen-reader announcements would be too intrusive due to the summary content
updating when the `FormState` does.
